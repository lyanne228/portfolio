            <p><em>When</em> Mar - May 2017<br/><em>Where</em> Northwestern University, IL, USA<br/><em>Main role</em> Student, Web Designer</p>
            <p>As part of my Segal Design Certificate, I had to create a website to showcase the projects that I have been involved in. I decided to make this website a project itself, and build it from scratch.</p>
            <p>I designed all the graphics, animations and illustrated banners, and put them together using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionTitle">Drawing the Banners and Icons</h4>
        <section class="twoCols">
          <div class="twoColsA">
            <p>I enjoy animation and wanted to show my competencies in animation on my website, but I didn't want the animation to overwhelm any page. I decided to have a few feature animations on the landing page, and a few scattered throughout the website (not yet complete).</p>
            <p>This was extremely time-consuming and reviewers gave me feedback at each stage to have a placeholder for images or animations that have not been drawn. This creates a more complete website, with the opportunity to add-on illustrations or animations in the future.</p>
            <p>An example is the Projects overview page, where each section has one illustrated background, which will be animated in the future. The About Me page also features pictures in the background, that will be replaced with illustrations or animations. Although there are further improvements to be made, these pages still look more or less complete.</p>

        <h4 class="sectionTitle">Arranging and Organizing</h4>
        <section class="twoCols">
          <div class="twoColsA">
            <p>My initial plans for the website and the final layout are quite different. I had initially planned everything out on a PowerPoint slide before starting any coding or illustrations, but translating the design on the PowerPoint slide to HTML looked a little off to me. Perhaps it had something to do with the aspect ratios or the browser's navigation bar at the top of the screen, but I was not satisfied with the first drafts of the website.</p>
            <p>I decided to go for a more illustrated website, and make the pictures less imposing by reducing their size or recoloring a big banner image so that it doesn't stand out as much. This made my illustrations stand out more.</p>
