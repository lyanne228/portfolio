1)  Look in StarterCode_SecondDay.zip, in the 'lib' directory.  There you'll
find the library file 'cuon-matrix-quat.js', an extended version of the book's
rudimentary vector/matrix library ('cuon-matrix.js').   Add a line of text
here to use that library in this simple program:

>
    <script src="lib/cuon-matrix-quat.js"></script>

<!
2) Explore the 'cuon-matrix-quat.js' library.
In it you'll find objects 'Vector3', 'Vector4' and 'Matrix4',
which each have member functions to help you manipulate
3x1 vectors, 4x1 vectors and 4x4 matrices useful for computer graphics work,
as well as a 'quaternion' object we will use later for rotations.

3) Search this file for the string 'console', and you'll find that the 'Matrix4'
object has a 'printMe()' member function.  Try it!
     ?HOW? at the bottom of main(), create a new 'Matrix4' object, and use one of its
'setXXX()' member functions to initialize the matrix to some desirable set of
values.  Can you create and print an identity matrix?  A 'translate' matrix?
A 'scale' matrix?.

4) Next, see if you can create and print a Vector3 object and a Vector4 object.
Hmmm.  I don't see any 'printMe()' member functions or equivalent.  However,
we CAN set individual vector elements using array-like syntax (e.g. aVec[0]=3.0;)
and we CAN use console.log() calls to print the values of each vector's individual
elements.
 		Note how awkwardly I did this in the 2.02.HelloPoint1_MatrixOps.js file--
I assign the vector to 'tmp' so that I can re-use the same console.log() function
(cut-and-paste) without modifying it much.
Wouldn't it be much nicer, much more professional to add 'printMe()' member function
to the Vector3 and Vector4 objects defined in our 'cuon-matrix-quat.js' library?
 for these as well?
		Try it!  Save a numbered copy of the current version (e.g. cuon-matrix-quat01.js)
to ensure you can always 'go back' if needed.  Use the existing code to explore how
to add new member functions to Vector3 and Vector4 objects (unsure? Google can help,
and/or refer to one of the good JavaScript tutorials mentioned last week).  Start
simply, add things incrementally, test each addition thoroughly, only make one
improvement between each test; be sure one improvement works before you begin the next.

5) Next, try out some basic vector/vector operations.
--Create two different Vector4 objects with nonzero elements.  Compute and print
their lengths in the console window. Can any Vector4 member function compute
that for you?  Should you add a new member fcn?  Can you normalize these vectors?

--Can you compute a 'dotProduct()' for two Vector4 objects?  Note that some of the
code within other functions computes dot products.  Wouldn't it be nice to
have a Vector4 member function to do this?  Try to make one; did it work? test it...

--Can you compute a 'crossProduct()' for two Vector4 objects? Wouldn't it be nice
to have a Vector4 member function to do this? Try to make one; did it work
